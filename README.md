Schelling's model of spatial segregation. 

Schelling's model of spatial segregation is a milestone in the study of emergent global phenomena based on local social interactions (Schelling 1969; Schelling 1971; Schelling 1978). Schelling's model illustrates how clearly distinctive patterns of spatial segregation (e.g. ghettos) can emerge even if individuals are only weakly segregationist.
